# WebForms++

## For when you have to use WebForms instead of MVC

## Download the project from this GitHub site and unzip
Do a restore nuget packages

## The Data is in the two zipped files WEBFORMSPLUSPLUS.zip & WEBFORMSPLUSPLUS_log.zip
Unzip both data files and MSSMS attach to the .mdf file
Move both files to a new same folder where MMMSMS can see the .mdf, and give the folder rights, and  id doesn't hurt to make the folder NOT readonly.

The set of mdf and ldf files can be attached to your TSQL.  
Modify your Web.Config for both connections.

Happy Programming.
