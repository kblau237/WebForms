# WebForms++

## For when you have to use WebForms instead of MVC

## Download the project from this GitHub site and unzip
Do a restore nuget packages

## The Data is in the two zipped files WEBFORMSPLUSPLUS.zip & WEBFORMSPLUSPLUS_log.zip
Unzip both data files and MSSMS attach to the .mdf file

The set of mdf and ldf files can be attached to your TSQL.  
Modify your Web.Config for both connections.

Happy Programming.
